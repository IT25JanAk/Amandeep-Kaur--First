## Russia-aligned hackers are targeting Signal users with device-linking QR codes

Manipulate the apps users into surreptitiously linking their devices While Russia's continued invasion of Ukraine is likely driving the country's desire to work around Signal's encryption  

The primary attack channel is Signal's "linked devices" feature, which allows one Signal account to be used on multiple devices, like a mobile device, desktop computer, and tablet.

Linking typically occurs through a QR code prepared by Signal

I visit a web page and find this useful to understand the whole senario.
